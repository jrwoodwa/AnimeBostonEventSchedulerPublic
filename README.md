ðŸ—“ Anime Boston Scheduler Planner
Scrapes the Anime Boston 2025 schedule using pandas/beautifulsoup and optimizes event choices using linear programming.

Features:
- Extracts full event grid with time, room, category, and color
- Filters low-utility events and early low-value ones

Solves the schedule as an assignment problem via LP

âœ… What's done:
- âœ… Completed the web scraping in a notebook that captures the data, processes it (including subevents like Maid Cafe going into 45-min block options), and tidies it.
- âœ… Write a `WebScrape.py` script for translating data engineering into a CSV (optionally: store timestamp when the script queries data).
- âœ… After the CSV is fully ready, manually utility score the information.
- âœ… With the data prepped, write the LP mathematical model in the notebook.
- âœ… After the LP model is defined, write the code.
- âœ… Observe results in a displayed itinerary.
- âœ… Standardize code in `MathOptModel.py`, visualize in itineraries.
- âœ… Circle actual schedules (+with backup events)
- âœ… Make refinements to the LP model/visualizations/etc based on feedback from party members.
- âœ… Finalize actual schedules with party (+with backup events)
